# Tuesday’s House

Welcome to the filesystem equivalent of the Winchester Mystery House. This is a containerized, recursive, privilege-confused, symlink-riddled matryoshka of a server designed to push the limits of your patience, Docker’s patience, and probably Linux’s sanity.

## Features
- **Recursive chroots:** Why have one rootfs when you can have three?
- **Symlinks upon symlinks:** Not just a best practice, it’s a lifestyle.
- **Privileged containers:** sudo NOPASSWD because, at this point, why not.
- **Admin ‘outer’ shell via tmux:** For when you really, really need to touch the forbidden network plumbing.
- **/proc, /sys, /dev mounted everywhere:** If you can’t break out, you can always make things weird.
- **Docker in Docker in Docker:** Like a digital turducken but with more existential risk.

## Usage
If you’re reading this, you are either lost, very curious, or about to create more problems than you solve. Proceed with reckless abandon (but please don't delete anything, because it's really annoying to have to restore things from backup).

1. Explore as `tuesday`, but don’t expect anything to make sense.
2. Use tmux to ascend to the ‘outer’ shell, if you need to touch reality.
3. Leave notes for future Tuedays. Or don’t. They’ll find a way.

## Warnings
- *Security audits will not be kind.*
- *There is no documentation, only Zuul.*
- *If you have to ask, the answer is probably ‘no’.*

*Created on a Tuesday. Maintained on a dare.*
